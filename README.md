# Anime_Character_Image_classifier
 The Jupyter Notebook within this repo contains a custom Pytorch Convolution Neural Network used to classify anime images from 2 curated datasets originally sourced from the paper [AniWho: A Quick and Accurate Way to Classify Anime Character Faces in Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11012v3). This dataset uses four classes, with 50 images each.

 Within the notebook is a full walkthrough showing how data was loaded, the model build and layers calculated, training, and performance validation. Additionally, there are visualizations included to assess the dataset, overall model performance, and prediction accuracies.
